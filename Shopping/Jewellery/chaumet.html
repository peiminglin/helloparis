  <p>and cutting for building purposes, but the great proportion of it is 
not. Dr. Jackson thus describes the geology of Streaked mountain : 
''It is composed of a coarse variet}' of granite which has burst 
through the surrounding gneiss that recline upon its sides, and form 
a large proportion of its mass. The granite appears in huge veins 
which run east- north-east and west-south-west. The gneiss alter- 
nates with granular limestone suitable for agricultural purposes.

stream once much larger and probably marking the course of a 
large arctic river, been lowering its channel, making cuts through 
the hills and filling up the vallej's and preparing the waj' for this 
great international thoroughfare of travel and traffic. There is in 
town a number of gravelly ridges formed b}" glacial or Kame rivers. 
The waters of the upper Androscoggin lake region once united in 
one grand stream which flowed from Lake Welokennebacook south- 
ward through a ver^' low pass and down the valley of Black Brook 
and Ellis River. From Rumford Point, the course of the Kame is 
up the vallev of the West branch of the Concord River, thence 
through a part of Bethel, and through a low pass in Woodstock to 
Bryants Pond.* The Kame through Bethel and through a part of 
Woodstock has been called the "Whale's Back" for a hundred 3'ears. 
It passes down the Little Androscoggin, enters the town at the 
northwest corner passes through it, and keeping straight on south- 
wardly passes through Poland, New Gloucester and Gray, at the 
latter point forming a series of reticulated Kame-plains. Li its pas- 
sage through Paris, it does not have that regularity of form that it 
does farther toward the north, being frequently broken and divergent 
from a right line, 3'et sufficienth' well defined for the practiced eye 
to trace it. 

The only ponds, are Moose Pond near North Paris, and Hall's 
near the southeast part of the town. The former is the larger, and 
besides receiving a suppl}' from the watersheds formed b}^ the hills 
in the vicinit}', it has an inlet which rises in tha Spruce Hills on the 
east line of the town, and which before reaching the pond, unites 
with one from Sumner and another from Woodstock. The water- 
shed formed b}' No. 4 Hill, Singepole and tha hill north of it, sup- 
plies Hall's Pond, and its surplus waters flow southerly into Oxford. 
Near North Paris, is a chalibeate spring having a stiong sulphurous 
taste and smell, and whose waters are quite popular with some for 
their supposed medicinal qualities. 

The Geolog}' and Mineralogy of Paris are much the same as those 
of the entire region of northern Maine west of Penobscot river. 
The rocks are the primaiy or azoic series above which the other 
series are wanting till we arrive at the tertiary clay, diluvium and 
alluvium. Some coarse limestone may be found upon the hillsides 
alternating in strata with gneiss. Granite is abundant both as a bed 
rock and in the form of boulders ; some of it is suitable for rifting
