  <p>and cutting for building purposes, but the great proportion of it is 
not. Dr. Jackson thus describes the geology of Streaked mountain : 
''It is composed of a coarse variet}' of granite which has burst 
through the surrounding gneiss that recline upon its sides, and form 
a large proportion of its mass. The granite appears in huge veins 
which run east- north-east and west-south-west. The gneiss alter- 
nates with granular limestone suitable for agricultural purposes.

The granite veins are rich in large and beautiful crystals of beryl, 
black tourmaline and large plates of mica ; common garnets also 
abound, and quartz ciystals line cavities in the rock. It will be 
observed b}- the geologist who may visit this mountain, that the 
strata of gneiss have evidently been forced up by a sudden and vio- 
lent eruption of the granite ; for not only are the strata turned up 
and contorted, but fragments of gneiss have been torn off b}' the 
intruding rock, and are seen imbedded in its mass. The strata also 
recline upon the granite through which passes the anticlinical axis 
of the strata." He thus speaks of the mountain itself: ^'Streaked 
mountain is an important landmark for the country around, owing to 
its commanding situation. From its summit a most interesting 
panoramic view ma\^ be seen of the towns, lakes and mountains 
around, and it has justly become a place of resort on account of its 
picturesque scenery." He found the height of the mountain to be 
925 feet above Paris Hill and 1756 above highwater at Portland. 
This gives Paris Hill a height of 831 feet above the sea level. He 
found the bearings of several points from the top of Streaked moun- 
tain to be as follows : Pleasant Mountain in Denmark, north peak 
south 65 degrees west ; southern peak, south 60 degrees west and 
the central peak, south 64 degrees west. Kearsarge Mountain in 
New Hampshire, south 82 degrees west ; Paris church, north 68 
degrees west ; center of Norway village, south 77 degrees west ; 
Hebron Peak, south 30 degrees east ; Singepole Hill, south 54 
degrees west ; Norway pond was found to be two degrees and fifteen 
minutes below the horizontal line from the mountain. Bog iron ore 
exists in town : Dr. Jackson speaks of finding it on the estate of 
Dea. Porter near Greenwood, but not in suflficient abundance to sup- 
pi}' a furnace. There is a tradition that bog iron ore taken from 
Ripley's hill, was taken to Boston on horseback, there smelted and a 
set of harrow teeth made from the proceeds, but this needs authenti- 
cation. The rare and valuable group of minerals found at Mount 
Mica by Elijah L. Hamlin, have a reputation among mineralogists

the world over. Dr. Jackson speaks of them as "plates of crystal 
mica from six to ten inches square, berj^l of various shades of green, 
limpid and smoky quartz, black, green, blue and red tourmaline, 
rose quartz, feldspar, garnets, &c." Dr. Jackson was able to 
obtain a set of these minerals for the State cabinet. Speaking of 
these rare tourmalines in a later report, Dr. Jackson said: "They 
are green tourmaline, of a rich pistachio, olive and emerald green 
color, frequentl}^ transparent, and equalling the emerald in beauty." 
Since that time, many of these stones have been cut and are used 
for ornamental purposes. The Mount Mica tourmalines are in man}^ 
respects unique, as admitted by all good judges. Besides these 
remarkable stones, the deposit has yielded many other minerals, 
some of which are interesting and rare. Among them may be men- 
tioned Cassiterite, Amblygonite, Lepidolite, Clevelandite, Spodu- 
mene. Zircon, Brookite, Cooksite*, Beryl, Leucopysite, Garnet, 
Apatite, Smoky and Rose quartz, and other minerals of lesser note. 
Dr. Jackson also described a considerable deposit of the black.
