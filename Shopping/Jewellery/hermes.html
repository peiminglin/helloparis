  <p>and cutting for building purposes, but the great proportion of it is 
not. Dr. Jackson thus describes the geology of Streaked mountain : 
''It is composed of a coarse variet}' of granite which has burst 
through the surrounding gneiss that recline upon its sides, and form 
a large proportion of its mass. The granite appears in huge veins 
which run east- north-east and west-south-west. The gneiss alter- 
nates with granular limestone suitable for agricultural purposes.

the smaller growths, were fouiid the alder, the wild pear and cherry, 
the white birch, poplar, moosewood, dogwood, and upon the sunn}^ 
slopes, the sumach. The American linden or baswood was a valua- 
ble forest tree, and in the swamps was found the fragrant white 
cedar. The long list of noxious weeds so damaging to the farmer, 
was unknown to the early settlers, except so far as thej* had obtained 
knowledge of them before coming here. Man}' of them have found 
their way across the sea, from the old country, since Paris was 
settled. Here in the spring time, blossomed the Benjamin, both the 
white and scarlet varieties, the Solomon's seal, the Sanguinaria, and 
scores of other indigenous plants which for ages, had ''wasted their 
sweetness on the desert air ;" around the ponds and along the bot- 
tom lands of the river, blossomed in beauty, the rhodora, the hard- 
hack and the laurel. The flowering shrubs were the wild pear, wild 
cherry, the dogwood, the wickgp^', the mountain ash and the elder. 
All along the Androscoggin, in early spring, the scarlet blossoms of 
the white maple were conspicuous, while the curious fronds of the 
many varieties of fern then as now, found their way out of the cold, 
damp earth, in a most m3'sterious manner. Brambles then grew in 
open glades, and in their season blossomed and bore delicious rasp- 
berries and blackberries which bird and beast appropriated ; the 
mild eyed violet looked up from its lowly bed by the stream, and 
even the wild strawberry was growing, blossoming and bearing its 
fruit here, with all the others, long before the advent of man. The 
fireweed too, must have been indigenous here, for it readily sprang 
up on the margin of everj- burnt piece, and the growing crop was, 
ere long enclosed in a border of pinky bloom. Such was the flora 
of Paris when a committee of the grantees first came to this region 
in 1771 for the purpose of locating a township for settlement. It is 
doubtful however, if their attention was as much directed to these 
forms of beaut\^, as to the strength and richness of the soil as indi- 
cated by the luxuriant growth of the trees, the size of the streams 
and their capacity' for propelling machinery, and the outlook gener- 
ally for a good agricultural town. And a noble primeval forest 
growth doubtless covered the entire township at the time. All the 
evidence which has come down to us, goes to show that the view of 
this region from the top of Streaked mountain, as Josiah Bisco and 
his party saw it in 1772, was grand and beautiful. The density of 
the forest hid the inequalities of the land, and on that leafy June 
day, the explorers might well think themselves looking down upon 
an emerald sea.
