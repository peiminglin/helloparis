  <p>Sister was engaged, preachers from neighboring towns were called in 
to supply, and Mr. Hooper alwa3's attended church. At one time 
a minister from Hebron was supplying the pulpit and in the fore- 
noon preached a very long, rambling and pros}^ sermon, occupying 
an hour and a half in its deliver3\ Elder Hooper was noted for his 
short sermons, rarel}" exceeding half an hour, and often not more 
than twent}" minutes, and being present on this occasion he became 
ver}' restive and impatient, and as soon as the "amen" was uttered 
from the pulpit, he arose and said in his inimitable way, "I give 
notice that there will be preaching in this church this afternoon by 
myself.

Elder Hooper had a black cur dog which always went to meeting 
with him, and during the services lay quietly on the steps of the 
pulpit. One Sunday the Elder was too unwell to preach and did not 
leave his house for the day. A supply was obtained, but the dog 
came alone to the meeting-house at the usual time, took his accus- 
tomed place on the steps, and at the close of the services quietly 
returned home. 

Daniel Macomber, the smithy, thought he had a call to . preach, 
and asked permission from the Baptist church, the members of 
which were generally favorable to him, but he was opposed by Elder 
Hooper. Macomber, meeting Mr. Hooper, asked him what he had 
against him. ''I haven't anything against you personally," said the 
plain-spoken parson, "but you know, Daniel, you are n't fit." There 
is no doubt he was right. 

A Mr. Eveleth was preceptor of Hebron Academy, and being on

a visit at Dr. Hamlin's, he was introduced to Elder Hooper, who 
chanced to drop in. Mr. Hooper asked him if lie was preceptor of 
Hebron Academy, to which he responded, "I am." He answered 
several other questions in a similar manner, when Mr. Hooper be- 
came impatient and said: *'Well, Mr. Eveleth, you have turned 
those goo(i old words 'yes' and 'no' out of doors at Hebron 
Academ}', haven't you?"
