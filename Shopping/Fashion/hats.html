to supply, and Mr. Hooper alwa3's attended church. At one time 
a minister from Hebron was supplying the pulpit and in the fore- 
noon preached a very long, rambling and pros}^ sermon, occupying 
an hour and a half in its deliver3\ Elder Hooper was noted for his 
short sermons, rarel}" exceeding half an hour, and often not more 
than twent}" minutes, and being present on this occasion he became 
ver}' restive and impatient, and as soon as the "amen" was uttered 
from the pulpit, he arose and said in his inimitable way, "I give 
notice that there will be preaching in this church this afternoon by 
myself.

entitled to such distinction, but as much space is devoted to this 
chapter as can be spared for the purpose. Brief notices have 
already been given of the grantees of the town, of the ministers,

chapter is to include those prominent citizens of Paris not embraced
