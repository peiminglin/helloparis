  <p>Sister was engaged, preachers from neighboring towns were called in 
to supply, and Mr. Hooper alwa3's attended church. At one time 
a minister from Hebron was supplying the pulpit and in the fore- 
noon preached a very long, rambling and pros}^ sermon, occupying 
an hour and a half in its deliver3\ Elder Hooper was noted for his 
short sermons, rarel}" exceeding half an hour, and often not more 
than twent}" minutes, and being present on this occasion he became 
ver}' restive and impatient, and as soon as the "amen" was uttered 
from the pulpit, he arose and said in his inimitable way, "I give 
notice that there will be preaching in this church this afternoon by 
myself.

Elder Hooper was in no wise in advance of his generation upon 
the temperance question, and though a "watchman upon the walls," 
it is doubtful if he saw and realized tlie evils of intemperance as 
early as did some of his people. Believing ardent spirits to be 
among the good things of this life, he was a frequent partaker,

though never drinking to excess. It is said by those who knew him, 
that he would frequenth^ seek inspiration for his afternoon sermon 
b}^ going to a friend's house near the church at noon, and asking for 
a glass of brand}^ which he alwa3's drank with great relish. On 
one occasion, during a week-day, he was sitting by a fire in the vil- 
lage store warming himself, when several of his parishioners dropped 
in, one at a time, and called for ardent spirits. This must have 
been after temperance began to be talked, for each one felt called 
upon to give some excuse as he called for his drink. One had a 
%evere cold, one had the toothache, and another rheumatism, and so 
on. Mr. Hooper bore it for some time, and then stepping to the 
counter, he said aloud and with peculiar emphasis, "I want a glass 
of brandy because I love it." 

Elder Hooper's first wife was a Merrill, from New Gloucester. 
They lost their two children from canker- rash, and soon Mrs. Hooper 
was attacked with consumption and all hopes of her recovery were 
abandoned. Reuben Hubbard had died, and his widow, who was 
the daughter of Benj. Stowell of Worcester, had returned to her 
father's. In view of his threatened bereavement, the Elder wrote 
to Mrs. Hubbard, and, stating the case, expressed the hope that she 
would not get married as he desired her for himself. She waited, 
and subsequenth^ became the wife of Elder Hooper.
