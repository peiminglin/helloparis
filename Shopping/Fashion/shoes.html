  <p>Sister was engaged, preachers from neighboring towns were called in 
to supply, and Mr. Hooper alwa3's attended church. At one time 
a minister from Hebron was supplying the pulpit and in the fore- 
noon preached a very long, rambling and pros}^ sermon, occupying 
an hour and a half in its deliver3\ Elder Hooper was noted for his 
short sermons, rarel}" exceeding half an hour, and often not more 
than twent}" minutes, and being present on this occasion he became 
ver}' restive and impatient, and as soon as the "amen" was uttered 
from the pulpit, he arose and said in his inimitable way, "I give 
notice that there will be preaching in this church this afternoon by 
myself.

It happened on one occasion that Mr. Hooper had an appoint- 
ment for an evening lecture at the house of Ezra Gary, who then 
owned and lived in the Phineas Morse stand and was himself a Con- 
gregationalist, though his son Shepard was a Baptist. A Mr. Hil- 
lard, a missionary of the Congregationalist church, was present at 
Mr. Gary's, and Mr. Hooper, on his arrival, noticing him in the 
room, asked: "Won't you preach this evening, Mr. Hillard?" ac- 
companying the question with the characteristic remark : "My wife 
sa3's she likes to go a visiting sometimes, even if she don't get any 
better victuals than her own." 

Mr. Hooper was a practical man. During the haying season, if 
there were signs of a shower, he often told his people from the pul- 
pit, that "if they had hay out, they had better go home and see to 
it ;" sometimes he would accompany these words with the remark 
that he "had ha}" out which needed his attention," and would at 
once close the service and start for his home and farm. 

After performing the marriage ceremony on a certain occasion 
where the prospects of the contracting parties were particularh' 
promising. Elder Hooper said : "This is as it should be; first the 
house, then the wife and then the children ; the order is too often 
reversed."
