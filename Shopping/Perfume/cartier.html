  <p>and cutting for building purposes, but the great proportion of it is 
not. Dr. Jackson thus describes the geology of Streaked mountain : 
''It is composed of a coarse variet}' of granite which has burst 
through the surrounding gneiss that recline upon its sides, and form 
a large proportion of its mass. The granite appears in huge veins 
which run east- north-east and west-south-west. The gneiss alter- 
nates with granular limestone suitable for agricultural purposes.

All accounts agree that wild animals were very plenty here before 
the settlers came to disturb them ; this was a favorite hunting ground 
for the Indians, and later for the settlers in the border towns. Here 
Snow had a camp and hunted with his companion, Stinchfield, and 
it was near Snow's Falls that he met his tragic death at the hands 
of the enraged Indians whose chief he had slain. Moose and deer 
were plenty and also bears and wolves. Of fur-bearing animals, 
foxes and sable were found in the woods, and mink, otter and beaver 
around the ponds and on the river and larger brooks. The most 
formidable wild animal was the American panther, but fortunately 
they were onl}' occasionally met with. After the settlers came, one 
of these animals chased a man named Macomber from the north 
part of Woodstock to Paris, and was seen prowling around the 
house where his intended victim had taken refuge. Then there were 
wild cats, loupcerviers, raccoons, and several varieties of the squirrel, 
including the black, gray, red and striped, or chipmunk. Partridges 
were in plenty and easil^y secured, as they were but little acquainted 
with man and his wicked wa^'s. Ducks were also abundant in the 
ponds, aud pigeons in their season. Trout could be taken from the 
brooks at any time with the proper appliances. The memory of the 
writer goes back to the time, fifty 3'ears ago, when speckled beauties 
weighing from one to two pounds, were quite abundant at the "rips" 
and in the "deep holes" of the Little Androscoggin at West Paris,, 
and the patient angler with baited hook, rarely went home disap- 
pointed. Fly-fishing was then unknown in that region. The Ham- 
monds had hunted here before the}' came to settle, and probably 
others whose names in this connection, have not come down to us. 
Many of the early settlers were experienced and expert woodsmen, 
and as the settlement grew and the surrounding towns became dotted 
with clearings, as their foes increased, the larger game retired before 
the advancing civilization to the northern wilderness in the lake 
region, and hunting as a business in the settled towns became profit- 
less and was abandoned except b}^ the thriftless.
