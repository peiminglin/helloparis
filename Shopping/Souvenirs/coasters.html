that never have received specific names. Of course, where there 
are so many hills there must be corresponding valleys, and as might 
be expected, most of the roads in town lead "up hill and down 
hill," and are hard to build and expensive to keep in repair. 

The Little Androscoggin is the only river in town, and this of 
small size. To this all the small streams in town except at thÂ« 
extreme southerh^ part, are tributary. The "Little Amariscoggin" 
was so called quite earh' for it is named in connection with the con- 
firmation of the grant to Joshua Fuller and others in 1772. Its 
head-waters are the Bryant Pond in Woodstock and Twitchell, 
Sheepskin, Oversett and other small ponds in Greenwood. It 
enters Paris from Greenwood near the northwest corner of the town, 
and flowing southeaster!}' it approaches nearest to the center of the 
town from east to west, when at or near Snow's Falls. Then it 
curves gradualh' to the west and passes into Oxford about two miles 
from the southwest corner of Paris. After passing into Oxford and 
running about a mile, it makes a sharp curve and again enters Paris, 
but reenters Oxford as abruptly as it leaves it. Its first important 
tributary after entering Paris is the East Branch, which comes down 
from Woodstock and unites with the west branch or river below 
West Paris. Farther down it receives the brook from High street 
and next the outlet of Moose Pond from North Paris. Below Bisco's 
Falls, it receives Stone's and Smith's brooks, and at South Paris, 
Stou}' brook, which is its last tributaiy received in Paris. Below 
South Paris, where the Androscoggin is the boundary between the 
two towns, the river receives from the Norway side an important 
tributary, the outlet of the great pond in Norway. There are sev- 
eral falls on the river and its tributaries which have been utilized, 
and which will be more particularly' described in another place. On 
the main river are water privileges above, and at West Paris, at 
Snow's and Bisco's Falls, at Jackson's and at South Paris. The 
mills at North Paris are on the Moose Pond branch. The falls on 
Ston}^ Brook, near South Paris, were the first utilized and here 
Lemuel Jackson built the first saw and grist mills in town. The bed 
of the Little Androscoggin made it possible for a railroad to be con- 
structed through the town. The, Grand Trunk road enters Paris 
from the south, near where the river goes out, and crossing it below 
South Paris, it follows its curve all the waj' to the northwest corner 
of the town, going out into Greenwood through the channel worn 
out by the river on its way into Paris. For ages, had this little
