southerly of the following described line, were taken from Norway 
and reannexed to Paris: "beginning in the northerl}' line of said 
lot number eight, and at the center of the old Rumford road, so 
called ; thence following said center southerly till it intersects the 
road from South Paris to Norway ; thence in a straight line through 
the agricultural grounds to the southeast corner thereof ; thence in a 
straight line to the northeasterl}" corner of Titus O. Brown's home- 
stead farm, so called ; thence to the easterly line of his said farm to 
the Little Androscoggin river, and thence by said river westerh' to 
the original line between Paris and Norway." By an act approved 
March 9, 1880, the estate of Caleb Fuller was set off from Wood- 
stock and annexed to Paris. This was part of the two lots, number 
twent3'-nine in the se|pond range and twenty-nine in the third taken 
from Paris in 1841. 

Paris is bounded north by Woodstock, east by Hebron, Buckfield 
and Sumner, south by Hebron and Oxford, and west by Oxford, 
Norway and Greenwood. Paris abounds in steep hills and the sur- 
face is generally very uneven. There are no high mountains, and 
in fact no elevation that hardl}^ deserves the name of mountain 
within its limits. Streaked mountain near the southeast corner, is 
in Hebron and Buckfield, though a small portion of its western 
slope and foot-hills are in Paris. No. 4 Hill near the southeast 
corner of the town and westerl}' from Streaked mountain, was 
formerly all in Paris and named from the Plantation or Grant, but 
its southerly side was set off into Hebron in 1817. Northwest of 
this is "Singepole," and near this is another considerable elevation 
without name. Along or near the eastern border are Crocker's Hill, 
Ones Hill and the Spruce Hills, while along through the center of the 
town from North to South, are Jump off* Hill, Stearns Hill and Paris 
Hill. Mount Mica with its rare minerals is easterly from Paris 
Hill. Berry's Ledge which was once called "Old Bluff" is on the 
northern border next to Woodstock, and west of that is another 
cropping out of the same ledge which was once called The 
"Belfry." This was set off into Woodstock in 1841, but was set 
back in 1880. Then near West Paris is Robinson's Hill, and east 
of High street is a considerable Hill without name. Cobble Hill, so 
called from the earh^ settlement of the town, is near the westerl}^ 
side of the town near the northeast part of Norway. Besides those 
mentioned, there are two hills west of the North Paris mineral 
spring, and various others of lesser note scattered through the town.
