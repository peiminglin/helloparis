James Brook,. Tailor, Hebron, Oct. 15, 1789, bonght of Israel 
Whittemore of Weston, lot No. 14 in the 2d range. This man's 
name in the town records, is variously spelled, "Broke," "Lebroke," 
"Le Brook' and ''Brook." The earliest and best authenticated 
orthography, is "Le Brook." In 1784, James Le Brook of Pem- 
broke, Mass., bought of Alexander Shepard, Jr., a lot of land in 
Hebron. For some reason, no deed was given of the land at the 
time, and in 1791, after the death of Shepard, a deed of the land 
was given ''Le Brook," by his executor. 

George Berry bought of Samuel Briggs of Sumner, in 1810, the 
northerly half of lot 27-28 in the 2d range. In 1811, Berry sold to 



HISTORY OF PARIS. 77 

Daniel Cummings of Norway, and two years later Cummiugs sold 
it to Levi Beny, who settled upon it and lived there many years. 
Briggs sold the southerly half of this lot to John Robinson in 1803. 
Levi Berr}' sold that part of the northerly half lying south of the 
Tiver, to Alexander Hill, in 1819. 

TiLDEN Bartlett, in 1805, bought of John AVillis, lot No. 28 in 
the 1st range, and settled upon it. 

Wm. Berry about 1810, bought No. 27-28 in the 3d range, and 
spent his life there. He sold a part to Foxwell Swan, and Swan a 
part of his to Elijah Swan. 

In the list of more than one hundred purchasers of real estate, 
are doubtless the names of man}* who did not settle upon the lands 
they bought. Indeed some of the lots changed hands several times 
before they were settled, and in quite a number of cases the same 
lands were sold to different parties, to be accounted for probabl}' in 
the fact that the first purchasers failed to pay. It was not intended 
by this list to locate the early settlers : that will be done in another 
place. This list is made merely to show who the early real estate 
owners in Paris were, when they first purchased as appears of record, 
and their place of residence at the time. Doubtless a few early 
purchasers neglected to have their deeds put upon record which 
accounts for the fact that some persons sold lands where no other 
evidence can be found that thev ever own'ed them. Only such per- 
sons are contained in this list whose deeds are recorded in the Cum- 
Ix'rland county records. The Registry in Oxford county was 
established in 1806. Possiblv some of the old deeds may he found 
recorded in the Oxford County Registry.
