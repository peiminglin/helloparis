come into possession of their lands. Thej' asked the Court therefore, 
to annul the former plan, in order that a township might be laid out 
to them which should be square instead of angular to correspond 
with the line which was supposed to be that of S^'lvester Canada, 
which would not only make a more convenient town, but would be 
vastly more commodious for other townships which hereafter might 
be laid out adjoining thereto. The prayer of the petition was 
granted by the patient and indulgent Geneml Court, and a plan 
adopted which described the metes and bounds as follows : 

"Beginning at a Hemlock tree two hundred and fiftj-two chains 
from the southwest corner of Sylvester Canada ; thence north 14 
degrees west seven hundred and seventy-seven chains to a stake and 
stones ; thence south sixt3'-eight degrees and thirt}' minutes west 
three hundred and sixt\' chains to a stake and stones ; thence south 
fourteen degrees east seven hundred and seventy-seven chains to a 
stake and stones ; thence north 68 degrees and thirtv minutes east 
three hundred and (sixt}^) eight chains to the Hemlock tree first men- 
tioned." 

The same conditions were imposed that were contained in the 
former grant. The matter passed the council and was consented to 
b}' the Governor on the 11th da}' of February, 1773. 

At a meeting on the last Tuesday in March following, it was voted 
to lot out the township and run out and mark the town bounds. 
The committee for this purpose, were Josiah Bisco, Josiah Brown 
and Elijah Livermore. Mr. Bisco afterwards settled in the grant, 
and Mr. Livermore settled in Port Royal and gave his name to the 
town when incorporated. Provision was also made at this meeting 
to dispose of delinquent rights, and an assessment was made of 
twenty shillings on each proprietor's right.
