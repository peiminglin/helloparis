A 
committee consisting of Nathaniel Stone, Nehemiah Mason and 
William Coolidge, was chosen to prosecute or defend an}- action or 
actions wherein the interests of the Proprietary might be concerned, 
with full power of substitution. Josiah Bisco was one of the party 
who went tO lot out the township, and his journal beginning August 
22, 1772, will be found in the appendix. 

The township granted to Joshua Fuller and others, June 11, 1771, 
in lieu of the township granted in 1736, had now been viewed and 
a plan made of it, aijd the grant had been confirmed by the General 
Court in accordance with the plan presented. Those familiar with 
the boundaries of Paris at the present time, will hardly recognize 
the town by the metes and bounds described in the plan presented 
to the court. The fact was, the committee appointed b}' the pro- 
prietors to view and make a plan of the land, had made a grave 
mistake which was soon detected b\' the later committee appointed 
to divide the township into lots, as will be seen by their report which 
was as follows : 

''We a committee chosen b}' the proprietors of No. 4 to lot out 
part or the whole of said township, do report as followeth, viz. : 
After having lotted out part of said township, we found that we did 
not adjoin to Sylvester Canada, (Turner) , nor an^^ former grant as 
was the order of court, therefore we have not proceeded to finish 
the whole until the proprietors knew the situation of the township 
as it now lieth." 

Thereupon another committee was appointed consisting of Alex- 
ander Shepard, Alexander Shepard, Jr., and Capt. Wm. Coolidge, 
to prepare a plan of the township with such alterations as they 
should think proper, to be submitted to the Great and General 
Court for confirmation and approval. The memorial presented by 
this committee to the Court, stated that the committee to view and 
make a plan of the grant, as also the pilot, had been deceived by 
taking a hunter's line to be the bounds of Sylvester Canada.
